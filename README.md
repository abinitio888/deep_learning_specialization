If you want to break into cutting-edge AI, this course will help you do so. Deep learning engineers are highly sought after, and mastering deep learning will give you numerous new career opportunities. Deep learning is also a new "superpower" that will let you build AI systems that just weren't possible a few years ago. 


**Learning Outcomes:**
* Understand the major technology trends driving Deep Learning.
* Be able to build, train and apply fully connected deep neural networks.
* Know how to implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks.
* Understand the key parameters in a neural network's architecture.


**Programming assignments:**

* Week 2: Logistic regression with a neural network mindset [[ipynb](Course_1/Week2/Week_2_Logistic+Regression+with+a+Neural+Network+mindset.ipynb)]
* Week 3: Planar data classification with one hidden layer [[ipynb](Course_1/Week3/Week_3_Planar+data+classification+with+one+hidden+layer.ipynb)]

## About Course 2: Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization
* 3 weeks, 3-6 hours/week


This course will teach you the "magic" of getting deep learning to work well. Rather than the deep learning process being a black box, you will understand what drives performance, and be able to more systematically get good results. You will also learn TensorFlow. 

** Learning Outcomes:** 
* Understand industry best-practices for building deep learning applications. 
* Be able to effectively use the common neural network "tricks", including initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, Batch normalization, gradient checking.
* Be able to implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence. 
* Understand new best-practices for the deep learning era of how to set up train/dev/test sets and analyze bias/variance.
* Be able to implement a neural network in TensorFlow.


**Programming assignments:**
* Week 1: Initialization [[ipynb](Course_2/Week_1_1_Initialization.ipynb)], Regularization [[ipynb](Course_2/Week1_2/Week_1_2_Regularization.ipynb)], Gradient checking [[ipynb](Course_2/Week1_3/Week_1_3_Gradient+Checking.ipynb)]
* Week 2: Optimization methods [[ipynb](Course_2/Week2/Week_2_Optimization+methods.ipynb)]
* Week 3: Tensorflow tutorial [[ipynb](Course_2/Week3/Week_3_Tensorflow+Tutorial.ipynb)]

## About Course 3: Structuring Machine Learning Projects
* 2 weeks of study, 3-4 hours/week

You will learn how to build a successful machine learning project. If you aspire to be a technical leader in AI, and know how to set direction for your team's work, this course will show you how.

Much of this content has never been taught elsewhere, and is drawn from my experience building and shipping many deep learning products. This course also has two "flight simulators" that let you practice decision-making as a machine learning project leader. This provides "industry experience" that you might otherwise get only after years of ML work experience.

** Learning Outcomes:**  
* Understand how to diagnose errors in a machine learning system, and 
* Be able to prioritize the most promising directions for reducing error
* Understand complex ML settings, such as mismatched training/test sets, and comparing to and/or surpassing human-level performance
* Know how to apply end-to-end learning, transfer learning, and multi-task learning

## About Course 4: Convolutional Neural Networks
* 4 weeks of study, 4-5 hours/week

This course will teach you how to build convolutional neural networks and apply it to image data. Thanks to deep learning, computer vision is working far better than just two years ago, and this is enabling numerous exciting applications ranging from safe autonomous driving, to accurate face recognition, to automatic reading of radiology images. 

** Learning Outcomes:** 
* Understand how to build a convolutional neural network, including recent variations such as residual networks.
* Know how to apply convolutional networks to visual detection and recognition tasks.
* Know to use neural style transfer to generate art.
* Be able to apply these algorithms to a variety of image, video, and other 2D or 3D data.
